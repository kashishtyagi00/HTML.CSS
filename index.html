       <em>hiiiiiiiiiiiii</em> my name is kashish tyagi 
        I'm 21 years old 
        I belong from a famous city for wood carving Saharanpur up
        currently pursuing my engineering in computer science and co-founder of a food tech start-up homians
        I love to dance read books and I'm also a volleyball player 
        I believe in self-learning and that's why I keep learning continuously for my self-growth and to become the best version of myself
        coming from a farmer's family my father always taught me that there's no substitute for hard work
        I'm girls who smile through everything
        strongly believed that don't let anyone's expectations define what you should be or what you should be
        it does matter what your circumstances are, it does matters how large your dreams are, and it's your responsibility to make that happen.</p>
